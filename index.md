### Experiences
#### [Mathematical Modeling to Forecast U.S. Elections](https://thenurj.com/2020/06/13/mathematical-modeling-of-u-s-elections/)
*   Simulated elections with the use of a compartmental model and forecasted results at the state level
*   Backtested model on past elections and used it to forecast 2020 presidential elections
*   See the link above for an abstract and short presentation on our work so far
