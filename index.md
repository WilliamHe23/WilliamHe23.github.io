### Experiences
#### Mathematical Modeling to Forecast U.S. Elections
*   Simulated elections with the use of a compartmental model and forecasted results at the state level
*   Backtested our model on past elections to analyze our forecast accuracy
*   Produced forecasts for the 2020 elections and hosted on [our website](https://modelingelectiondynamics.gitlab.io/2020-forecasts/)
